"""
In this assignment, you will train a deep neural network model
to classify handwritten digits from the the MNIST dataset.

A neural network library, PNet, built on numpy is given. Lots of common
mathematic operations and data structures are provided in pnet.ops.array
and pnet.ops.math. Some common neural network operations are provided in
pnet.ops.nn. These operations usually can be expressed using basic mathematic
operations, but are wrapped for convenience and computational efficiency and
correctness. Several different optimization algoritms based on the gradient
descent method are provided to compute gradients on learnable parameters.

Example: Linear Regression using PNet
    In linear regression, we need to fit a line to a set of training samples
    consisting of input features and corresponding target values. To do this,
    we can minimize the square (L2) loss or mean squared error (MSE) between
    actual values and predicted ones, i.e.
        minimize L = 1/2 \sum_i (h(x^(i)) - y^(i))^2      (L2 loss)
    or
        minimize L = 1/(2N) \sum_i (h(x^(i)) - y^(i))^2   (MSE loss)
        subject to
                h(x) = x*w + b
    where x^(i) denotes the input features of the i-th sample, y^(i) is the target
    value for x^(i), N is the total number of samples, * denotes the dot product
    between x and w, and w and b are the parameters we want to learn.

    We can use gradient descent on a batch of samples to optimize for w, and b.
    To do so, we need to compute the gradient of the loss function L with respect to
    the parameters w and b, and update the parameters as:
        w <- w - alpha * Nabla_w L
        b <- b - alpha * Nabla_b L
    where Nabla_w L is the gradient of L w.r.t. w and Nabla_b L is the
    gradient of L w.r.t. b, as computed using a batch of samples and the current values
    of w and b.

    In assignment 4, we gave you the explicit form of Nabla_w L and Nabla_b L
    and you used them to perform gradient updates. When using a deep learning framework,
    typically, we only need to write down the expression for the loss function and all
    gradient computation will be done by the underlying framework. The same applies to PNet.

    Suppose you are given a batch of samples x with shape [N, d], each of
    which has d features, and the corresponding actual values y with shape [N]
    To perform linear regression in PNet, we first need to define the
    parameters w and b:
        import pnet as nn           # import PNet
        w = nn.zeros([d, 1])        # initialize w as a d-by-1 zero matrix
        b = nn.zeros([1])           # initialize b as a 1-element vector
    and an optimizer
        opt = nn.SGD([w, b], learning_rate)
    nn.SGD is a naive stochastic gradient descent optimizer. It accepts two
    arguments: the first one is a list of all parameters that need to be
    optimized and the second one is the learning rate.

    Then, we need to run several iterations and update the value of w and b
    using a batch of samples (x, y) for each iteration.
    Given x, the predictions, h(x) = x*w + b, can be written as
        x = nn.constant(x)          # declare x as a constant such that
        h = nn.matmul(x, w) + b     # no gradient will be propagated to it
        N = x.shape[0]
        assert(h.shape == [N, 1])
    The MSE loss can be obtained by:
        loss = nn.mse_loss(h,y)
    We usually prefer MSE over L2 to prevent a large loss when the batch size is huge.
    Then, we call PNet to perform backpropagation and compute gradients:
        loss.backward()
    and call the optimizer to update the parameters:
        opt.step()
    Before going into the next iteration, we need to clear the currently stored
    gradients by calling:
        opt.zero_grad()

    A parameter also can be initialized from a python list:
        w = nn.parameter([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], dtype=nn.float32)
        # w is a zero 2-by-3 matrix
    or from a numpy array:
        np_array = np.random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1, size=[2, 3])
        w = nn.parameter(np_array)              # copy assignment
    or
        w = nn.parameter.from_numpy(np_array)   # reference assignment

    We call parameters and results of operations Tensor. The value stored in a
    tensor can be inspected by
        tensor.item()
    The item() method will return a read-only numpy array object containing
    the same value with tensor.
    The value stored in a tensor can be changed by assign() method. Do NOT do
    this unless you know what you are doing.

To differentiate from the linear regression example, you have to modify the code
below to train a neural network for solving multi-class classification problems.
In the network, each hidden layer is a linear function similar to h(x) above,
which must then be activated using a non-linear activation function such as tanh
or relu. In addition, the softmax_cross_entropy loss should be used that
converts the linear output layer to softmax probabilities, and then estimates the
softmax loss between computed probabilities and actual labels.

Try different learning rates, batch sizes, hidden layer sizes, number of hidden layers
and initial values for the parameters. You should be able to achieve at least 97%
accuracy on the test set after training for a few epochs.
